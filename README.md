# nsdSim

nsdSim ((Unofficial) Nationstates Democracy Simulator) is an app for simulating elections for your Nationstates country. <br>
There is a more user-friendly [web version](https://github.com/carrotstastegood/ns-democracy-sim) being very slowly developed. It will probably pick up speed once I finish this version.

## How to use.

Currently, the app is not able to be used properly as it is far from done.

## Planned features

* Let citizens vote on issues.
* Federal elections.

## In progress

* Designing the issue election simulator.
